											* If IVGVAR=0 the code will enforce the same velocity gradient in every step. The
												load conditions are read from a PROCESS file: path\name are declared in this line
											* If IVGVAR=1 the code will call SUBROUTINE VAR_VEL_GRAD at each
												deformation step (see description in Section 2-3-2) and read the components of the
												velocity gradient UDOT and time increment TINCR from a file (typically, the
												deformation history of a given element generated by a FE code) whose path and name
												is declared in VPSC7.IN.
											* If IVGVAR=2 the code calculates a 2-dimensional projection of the Polycrystal
												Yield Surface, by probing the aggregate with strain-rate vectors contained in the
												projection subspace. Instead of a PROCESS file the user should provide in this line
												the two components (out of the 5 deviatoric components) defining the projection subspace
												(see Section 2-5 and EXAMPLE2).
											* If IVGVAR=-2 the code calculates a 5-dimensional Polycrystal Yield Surface, by
												probing the aggregate with regularly spaced strain-rate vectors or stress vectors.
												Codes prompt user to enter spacing and type of probe.
											* If IVGVAR=3 the code calculates the Lankford coefficient by simulating tensile
												tests in the (x1,x2) plane of the texture (see EXAMPLE2). Instead of a PROCESS file
												the user should provide in this line the angular increment (in degrees) for the tensile
												‘probing’, from the RD to the TD.
											* If IVGVAR=4 the code rotates rigidly the crystallographic and the morphologic
												texture of the grains. An example (see EXAMPLE10) is the simulation of an ECAE
												route, where after each pass the sample is rotated and reinserted in the die. The
												second line gives the path and name of a file containing the 3x3 rotation matrix to be
												used for the rigid rotation (see Section 2-3-3 for description).
pcysSection		1x2			uint	1 2		Section of stress space for PCYS
